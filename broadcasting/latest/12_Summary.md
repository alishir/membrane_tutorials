As you can see converting an RTMP or RTSP stream to HLS might not be the easiest task. However, some understanding of the protocols and the usage of a couple of prefabricated elements in the Membrane Framework make up a rather compact solution. Importantly, such solution is open for modification and easily extensible.

HLS is one of the most popular media streaming protocols. Its advantages are using HTTP, allowing it for traversing over firewalls. It also allows for adaptive bitrate, i.e. it changes the resolution of the video based on the network bandwidth. Unlike RTMP or RTSP it is highly scalable. You will often come across HLS in the media streaming industry, so it's useful to have some understanding of it.

We hope that you grasped the basic ideas of the RTMP and RTSP protocols as well as that you know how to create your 'to HLS' converter with the use of the Membrane Framework.
