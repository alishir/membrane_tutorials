# React Native Videoconfernce app with Membrane

In our videoroom tutorial, we showed you how to create a media server based on Membrane's RTC Engine and how to use it in web applications. Now it's time to learn how to create a videoconferencing mobile app that will use the same media server. We're going to use [React Native Membrane WebRTC library](https://github.com/membraneframework/react-native-membrane-webrtc).
