# Pipelines

Building `Pipeline`s is the way to create streaming applications with Membrane. Pipeline allows you to spawn `Element`s and establish data flow between them. Pipelines can also communicate with elements or terminate them. Elements within a pipeline are often referred to as its `children` and the pipeline is their `parent`.

Connecting elements together is called `linking`. 

To create a pipeline, you need to implement the [Membrane.Pipeline](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.html) behavior. It boils down to implementing callbacks and returning actions from them. For a simple pipeline, it's sufficient to implement the [handle_init](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.html#c:handle_init/2) callback, which is called upon the pipeline startup, and return the [spec](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.Action.html#t:spec/0) action, which spawns and links elements. Let's see it in an example:

## Sample pipeline

```elixir
Mix.install([
  :membrane_hackney_plugin,
  :membrane_mp3_mad_plugin,
  :membrane_portaudio_plugin,
])

defmodule MyPipeline do
  use Membrane.Pipeline

  @impl true
  def handle_init(_ctx, mp3_url) do
    spec =
      child(%Membrane.Hackney.Source{
        location: mp3_url, hackney_opts: [follow_redirect: true]
      })
      |> child(Membrane.MP3.MAD.Decoder)
      |> child(Membrane.PortAudio.Sink)

    {[spec: spec], %{}}
  end
end

mp3_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/membraneframework/membrane_demo/master/simple_pipeline/sample.mp3"

Membrane.Pipeline.start_link(MyPipeline, mp3_url)
```

The code above is one of the simplest examples of Membrane usage. It plays an MP3 file through your computer's default audio playback device with the help of the [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) audio I/O library. Let's digest this code and put it to work playing some sound.

> Membrane is written in Elixir. It's an awesome programming language of the functional paradigm with great fault tolerance and process management, which made it the best choice for Membrane.
> If you're not familiar with it, you can use [this cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/elixir) for a quick look-up.
> We encourage you to also take a [deep look into Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) and learn how to use it to take full advantage of all its awesomeness. We believe you'll fall in love with Elixir too!


To run the snippet, follow the steps below:
- Install [libmad](https://github.com/markjeee/libmad) and [portaudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio). Membrane uses these libs to decode the mp3 and to access your speaker, respectively. You can use these commands:
  - On Mac OS: `brew install libmad portaudio pkg-config`
  - On Debian: `apt install libmad0-dev portaudio19-dev`

- Option 1: Click the button below:

  [![Run in Livebook](https://livebook.dev/badge/v1/blue.svg)](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmembraneframework%2Fmembrane_core%2Fblob%2Freadme%2Fexample.livemd)

  It will install [Livebook](livebook.dev), an interactive notebook similar to Jupyter, and it'll open the snippet in there for you. Then just click the 'run' button in there.

- Option 2: If you don't want to use Livebook, you can [install Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html), type `iex` to run interactive shell and paste the snippet there.


## Sample pipeline explained

Let's figure out step-by-step what happens in the sample pipeline.

Firstly, we install the needed dependencies. They are plugins, that contain elements that we will use in the pipeline.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  :membrane_hackney_plugin,
  :membrane_mp3_mad_plugin,
  :membrane_portaudio_plugin,
])
```

Instead of creating a script and using `Mix.install`, you can also [create a Mix project](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) and add these dependencies to `deps` in `mix.exs` file.

After installing the dependencies, we can create a module for our pipeline:

```elixir
defmodule MyPipeline do
  use Membrane.Pipeline

end
```

Using the `Membrane.Pipeline` behaviour means we are treating our module as a Membrane Pipeline, so we will have access to functions defined in the `Membrane.Pipeline` module, and we can implement some of its callbacks. Let's implement the `handle_init/2` callback, which is a function that is invoked to initialize a pipeline during start-up:

```elixir
defmodule MyPipeline do
  use Membrane.Pipeline

  @impl true
  def handle_init(_ctx, path_to_mp3) do

  end
end
```

> If the concept of callbacks and behaviours is new to you, you can read more about it [here](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/typespecs-and-behaviours.html#behaviours), or see examples of behaviours in the Elixir standard library, for example the [GenServer](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/genserver.html) and [Supervisor](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/supervisor-and-application.html) behaviours.

We'll use `handle_init` to specify all its [elements](../glossary/glossary.md#element) as children and set up links between them to define the order in which data will flow through the pipeline:

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_init(_ctx, path_to_mp3) do
  spec =
    child(%Membrane.Hackney.Source{
      location: mp3_url, hackney_opts: [follow_redirect: true]
    })
    |> child(Membrane.MP3.MAD.Decoder)
    |> child(Membrane.PortAudio.Sink)

  {[spec: spec], %{}}
end
```

The [child](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.ChildrenSpec.html#child/2) function allows us to spawn particular elements. By piping one child to another with the `|>` operator, we can specify the order of the elements in the pipeline. Thus, the code above links `Membrane.Hackney.Source` to `Membrane.MP3.MAD.Decoder` and `Membrane.MP3.MAD.Decoder` to `Membrane.PortAudio.Sink`. Here's what they are:
- Hackney source - an element based on the [Hackney HTTP library](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney), that downloads a file via HTTP chunk by chunk, and sends these chunks through its `output` pad. We pass two options to it: a URL where the MP3 is stored and a flag to make it follow HTTP redirects.
- MP3 decoder - an element based on [libmad](https://github.com/markjeee/libmad), that accepts MP3 audio on the `input` pad and sends the [decoded](../glossary/glossary.md#decoding) audio through the `output` pad.
- PortAudio sink - an element that accepts decoded audio on its `input` pad and uses the [PortAudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio) library to play in on the speaker.

In our spec, we don't mention the names of the pads, because `input` and `output` are the defaults. However, we could explicitly specify them:

```elixir
spec =
  child(%Membrane.Hackney.Source{
    location: mp3_url, hackney_opts: [follow_redirect: true]
  })
  |> via_out(:output)
  |> via_in(:input)
  |> child(Membrane.MP3.MAD.Decoder)
  |> via_out(:output)
  |> via_in(:input)
  |> child(Membrane.PortAudio.Sink)
```

Even though not necessary here, [via_in](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.ChildrenSpec.html#via_in/3) and [via_out](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.ChildrenSpec.html#via_out/3) are useful in more complex scenarios that we'll cover later.

The value returned from `handle_init`:

```elixir
{[spec: spec], %{}}
```

is a tuple containing the list of actions and the state.
- Actions are the way to interact with Membrane. Apart from `spec`, you can for example return `terminate: reason` that will stop the elements and terminate the pipeline. Most actions, including `spec`, can be returned from multiple callbacks, allowing, for example, to spawn elements on demand. Check the [Membrane.Pipeline](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.html) behavior for the available callbacks and [Membrane.Pipeline.Action](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.Action.html) for the available actions.
- State is an arbitrary data that will be passed to subsequent callbacks as the last argument. It's usually a map. As we have no use for the state in this case, we just set it to an empty map.

When we have created our pipeline module, we can call [Membrane.Pipeline.start_link](https://hexdocs.pm/membrane_core/Membrane.Pipeline.html#start_link/3) to run it:

```elixir
Membrane.Pipeline.start_link(MyPipeline, mp3_url)
```

We pass to it the pipeline module and options, which in our case is the `mp3_url`. The options are passed directly to the `handle_init` callback.

Congratulations! You've just built and run your first Membrane application. Let's now have a deeper look at the elements.
